# Simple-Interpreter

A simple java project to interpret and calculate the basic Arithmetic operations.
The main goal of the project is to understand how compilers are implemented in practice moving  through all the three first phases  of a compiler:
* a. Lexical analysis.
* b. Syntax analysis.
* c. Semantic analysis.

## Inputs 
* String of basic Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
## Outputs
* The result of the operation calculated by the interpreter
